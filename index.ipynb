    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Blob, real, integer, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary keys uniquely identify rows within a table. Foreign keys identify rows for tables existing outside of the current table. A foreign key from one table can match up with the primary key within another table. This is necessary to creating JOIN statements within SQL framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-One: records line up exactly 1 to 1 across 2 or more tables.\n",
    "One-to-Many: records within 1 table match up with multple records within  another table i.e. 1 fish in a table is a compenent of another table, the school, which houses multple fish.\n",
    "Many-to-Many: each data point within a dataset match up with multple data points of another dataset and vica-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN: Returns data where keys match/overlap\n",
    "OUTER JOIN:Returns data where keys do not match/overlap\n",
    "LEFT JOIN: Returns data from left dataset and any matching keys within the right data set.\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN: Returns data from right dataset and any matching keys within the left data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate functions caclulate SUM, COUNT, MEAN, etc.\n",
    "GROUP BY statements allow you to group data based on categories, i.e. region, country, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "They allow us to keep track of the multiple connections between tables with many-to-many relationships in both directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
